## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Nice to meet you! If you're on this page you're probably one of my teachers.
My interests at the moment are Pokemon, Zelda, Pikmin, Yugioh, Spaltoon, and all things anime and retro games!
I'm an artist! I heavily dislike generative AI and cannot be friends with you if you support it.
I'm currently learning Japanese!
